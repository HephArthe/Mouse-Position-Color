# Color Picker Tool

A tiny personal project to pick colors from the screen and show the pixel coordinates of the mouse.

# Features

- Displays the hex color value of the pixel under the mouse (e.g., `#FF00FF`).
- Displays mouse position (X, Y) on the screen.
- Simple, lightweight, no extra dependencies.

# Usage

- Run the program.
- Press F10.
- Move the mouse over the screen.
- The overlay will show the color and pixel coordinates in real-time.
- **Right click** copies the hex color value.
- **Left click** copies the mouse position.
- Press **Esc** to exit the application.

# Notes

- Works on Windows.
- Overlay is almost invisible but still tracks mouse events.

# Goals / TODO

I’d love to figure out how to **make the overlay fully transparent** (so it’s completely invisible visually) **without letting right-clicks pass through the overlay.**
